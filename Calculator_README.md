A simple calculator I made while learning Python and preparing for Microsoft 98-381.
Uses Tkinter and comes with python. Do not need any external libraries.
Text field with light color shows the current value.
Dark field shows results and previous value and operation selected.
Operations where only one operand is required eg %,1/x are applied to light color field while in the middle of calculation or to the 
  darker textfield if done after calculation has finished.
Memory Ms show the value in memory in the light text field. M+/M- add/subtract to/from the current memory value dark field text
Mr removes the memory.
'calc.ico' is the icon for the calculator app and can be copied from repository
